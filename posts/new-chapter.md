2018, and the start of 2019, was a very difficult time for me. It's when I began to really doubt what I was doing with my life from a professional vantage. I had once lived by the old adage, "Find a job you love and you'll never work a day in your life", but had found myself dreading going to work.

The work I was doing is still what I like and will continue to do. I wrote HTML, CSS, and some light Javascript for a variety of clientelle across varied platforms. I provided guidance and feedback to accessibility practices on our own projects as well as others. I even played IT for a long while which I must say I'm incredibly under-qualified for.

The problem I found was with how projects went from a consulting vantage. Towards the end of 2018 I realized it wasn't my position, the people, or the company-at-large that I had issue with, but with the nature of our consultative development. I'd be assigned to a project, I'd come up with a front-end plan, I'd execute that plan, the project would launch (or not), and that would be that. A few weeks later I might find a better way to handle a component, but that project is done, the budget is depleted, and enhancements are rarely given the credit they deserve.

This is what development had boiled down to for me: create, hand off, move on. For some, this might be refreshing, but not for me. I love refactoring. I love reworking things that already work to be cleaner, leaner, work better, or any myriad of things that are involved with reworking code you've already written but that was never on the table.

Wednesday marked my last day, after 8 years combined of internships and full-time employment, at LookThink. It was by far the hardest decision to uproot something as stable as that to follow what I think I'm looking for but it was something I needed to do. With the move I'm moving away from general consulting type development and into more product-based development. My hope is that getting to bang on the same code will let me fufill that need to hone and refine my front-end skills in a more cohesive, tangible way.

Only time will tell if it was the _right_ move but it's just the right amount of uncomfortable to really test what I want to be doing with my daily dev skillset.
