Hi, I'm Greg Bruening - author and maintainer of front-end, neat.

I'm a front-end developer who focuses on creating simple, flexible, expandable front-end interfaces using HTML and CSS. I strive to make everything I write accessible for anyone using the web regardless of circumstances.

Currently I'm working on acquiring my CWAP Certification from the IAAP to further enhance my ability to advocate for an accessible web and helping businesses, designers, and developers understand the important of accessibility.

Feel free to drop me a line at [gbruening@pm.me](mailto:gbruening@pm.me) to say hi or follow me at any of the social links in the footer!
